This code implements the models used in the paper " Enhancement of the land use forecasting by incorporating deep features using convolutional neural networks and convolutional denoising autoencoders", which is a case study of land use change modeling in Saitama prefecture of Greater Tokyo Area. THe models include multilayer perceptron, hybrid convolutional neural networks, hybrid convolutional denoising autoencoder, and DINAMICA-based cellular automata model.

The Python version is 3.6. The neural networks models are developed based on PyTorch 0.4.
